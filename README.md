## **Installation and Setup**  

### **Step 1: Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)**  
Creating a virtual environment ensures that dependencies are installed in an isolated workspace.  
- On Windows:  
  ```
  python -m venv venv
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```
- On macOS/Linux:  
  ```
  python3 -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

### **Step 2: Install Dependencies**  
Once the virtual environment is activated, install the required dependencies:  
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **Step 3: Configure API Key**  
Ensure that your API key is correctly set up in the application.
